# Operating-System-Process-Scheduler
This project entails developing an example Operating System process scheduler capable of managing multiple programs performing tasks such as variable assignments, arithmetic operations, file I/O, and print commands. The system will incorporate two scheduling algorithms, namely Round Robin and Shortest Job First, to ensure efficient execution.
